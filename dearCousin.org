- There are 2 ACTIVE cases going on: *P22-1146* and *P22-1162*; 1 expired case of *P14-1307*
  - *P22-1146:*

  - *P22-1162:*

  - There are 2 Active cases, but the cases were only taken care of after the second P22-1162 incident, *which date for both cases were set up hearing on July 21, 2022*, and which were after the 2nd incident and I would have NO chance/opportunity to learn nor correct myself without IN TIME hearing after 1st incident.
- The above listed *P14-1307*: 
- 是当地的法院没有及时地通知我或是办理案件，让我没有机会学习和校正自己的行为, 不管是6/17号的，还是接下来的，我没有机会学习来校正自己
** Length of Order一年，多于一年，一辈子(法官真是生猛呀，一令就是一辈子。。。。。)

- Who came to US as an international student, *I do NOT have nor by any means learn and understand these legal terms*, and I *DO have been* interpreting the expireation of P14-1307 as permission to resume trying. As an previous girl friend who is still deeply falling in love for a previous boyfriend, who will stop trying by any means though?

- 是的，我以为保护令的期限到了便是过期了，我便可以retry 恢复男女朋友关系了。。。
- 听证会上，我向法官陈述了，我是国际留学生，对美国社会法律并不了解；

* 个人的认知层面的问题　　
- 法律是有期限的：所有的限制令都有过期的期限
* 保护令下达（被小地方的法官一羊判便判成了一辈子－－至2099呆槑槑槑槑 呵呵）后
- If you do not go to court, the judge can make the restraining order without hearing your side of the story. And the order can last up to 5 years.别人也就最多五年，他一弄就弄成了一辈子https://www.courts.ca.gov/1279.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en
- 原令保护令者，可是撒销保护令： The adverse party can file a Motion to Dissolve the protection order, and the court might schedule a hearing on the motion. The applicant can appear at the hearing to oppose the adverse party’s motion. If the Motion to Dissolve is granted after a hearing, the protection order will become immediately void and unenforceable.
- 我可以appeal反保护令： The adverse party can file a Motion to Modify the protection order, and the court might schedule a hearing on the motion.
- If an extended protection order is issued, the adverse party can file an appeal to the district court, and the district court might affirm, modify, or vacate the order. The extended protection order remains in effect during any appeal, unless the court orders otherwise.
** Appeal: https://www.civillawselfhelpcenter.org/self-help/harassment-protection/modifying-dissolving-or-appealing-a-protection-order
- What is an “appeal,” and how would I file one?
  - If the court issues an extended order for protection, the adverse party can file an appeal to the district court. (There is no appeal allowed if the court denies an application to extend a protection order, only if the court grants the extension.) The district court will typically not hear new evidence on an appeal. The court will review the documentation and other information that was presented to the justice court in order to decide whether the justice of the peace made any error of law in granting the extended protection order. 
- The district court can affirm, modify, or vacate the justice court’s order. (In other words, the district court can keep the order in place, change it in some way, or do away with it completely.) 
- TIP!  If the hearing on the extended protection order you're appealing was recorded, you must order a copy of the hearing transcript from the court reporter and deposit $100 with the court (unless some greater amount was ordered).  (JCRCP 74(b).)  If the hearing wasn't recorded, you must fill out and file the Statement of Evidence or Proceedings form below.

* Statements
- 现在的问题是我需要把文件也传给表哥吗？可是我只有一两天的时间[不用再担心这个问题，该发出去的邮件，该寄出去的材料全都寄出去了，最慢也三天之内可以到达了，不用担心]
－另外，法庭上还有哪些文件是需要我复制或是转达的吗｛暂时也不骼担心这个问题，先把明天傍晚5点前需要上交的材料准备好，交上去，并同步发送给亲爱的表哥就可以了｝
－我是否需要立即写封邮件问一下相关的工作人员｛已经打电话问好了，就不要再担心了｝

** harassment vs Stalking
 -“Harassment” occurs when:
  - The adverse party threatens to harm another person in the future, damages another person’s property, confines or restrains another person, or does any act intended to substantially harm another person’s physical or mental health or safety; AND
- The adverse party’s words or conduct causes the applicant to reasonably fear that the threats will be carried out.  (NRS 200.571.)
- “Stalking” occurs when: 
  - The adverse party engages in a course of conduct that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a family or household member, AND
The applicant actually feels terrorized, frightened, or intimidated or fearful for the immediate safety of a family or household member.  (NRS 200.575(1).)
